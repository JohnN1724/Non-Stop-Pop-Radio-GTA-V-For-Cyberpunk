Hello Choomba thanks for downloading the NSP Radio Mod!!!

///////////////// INSTALLATION NOTES \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

1. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE RADIOEXT DOWNLOADED AND INSTALLED FIRST
AS THIS MOD WON'T WORK WITHOUT IT!!!!

2. Follow the file path in downloaded file and place these files
in your Cyberpunk game to install the mod

3. Enjoy the tunes my choom!

///////// IF YOU ALREADY HAVE CUSTOM RADIO \\\\\\\\\\\\\\
/////// STATIONS INSTALLED PLEASE READ THIS! \\\\\\\\\\\\\

1. If you already custom radio stations install the mod
like you have for your existing radioExt stations

2. In your radiosInfo.json file add "NSP Radio" to your paths
for the station to be found

3. In the radio's metadata.json file (found in the NSP Radio
folder) the fm channel is set to 102.9, if you have other radio
stations set to this value already feel free to change the value to
whatever you fancy (change the value in the display name too if you
want everything to match!)

4. Enjoy the tunes my choom!

If you have any issues with installation or the mod itself or any requests/
suggestions to what radio stations to make next, please let me know in the
community tab of this mod!
